More flexibility. CocoaMarkdown allows you to define custom parsing hooks or even traverse the Markdown AST using the low-level API.
Efficient NSAttributedString creation for easy rendering on iOS and OS X. Most existing libraries just generate HTML from the Markdown, which is not a convenient representation to work with in native apps."
